# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles for macOS/linux

# Install:
<code>chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh</code>

# Notice:
Installing the dotfiles is not recommended.
The installation script also creates a watcher script that will automatically create symlinks to the dotfiles when they are changed.
Use at your own risk.
