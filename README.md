# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for linux
Installing the dotfiles is not recommended.
The installation script also creates a watcher script that will automatically create symlinks to the dotfiles when they are changed.
Use at your own risk.

# Install:

`./install.sh`
`s` to launch tmux session through sesh.
<Ctrl-s + I> inside tmux to install the required tmux plugins through tpm.
